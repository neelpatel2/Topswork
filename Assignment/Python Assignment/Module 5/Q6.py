# Q.6 Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?
"""
To load data into Django, you can use the loaddata management command. This command is used to import data from a fixture 
(which is a serialized format like JSON, XML, or YAML) into your Django application's database.

The loaddata command is a powerful tool in Django to load pre-defined data into your database, useful for populating models with 
initial or bulk data from fixture files.

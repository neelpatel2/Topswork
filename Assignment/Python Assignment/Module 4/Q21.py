#What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java.
'''
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects,"
which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The key OOP concepts are:

Classes and Objects:

Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure and the methods that can operate on that data.
Object: An instance of a class. It is created from a class and can have attributes and behaviors defined by the
class.
Encapsulation:
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class.
Inheritance:
A mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. It allows code reusability 
and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Polymorphism:
The ability of different objects to respond to the same function or method call in different ways.
Abstraction:
The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

Multiple Inheritance in Java:
In Java, multiple inheritance is not supported directly through classes. This means a class cannot inherit from
more than one class. The reason behind this is to avoid complexity and ambiguity, such as the "Diamond Problem" 
(where a class could inherit conflicting implementations of a method from multiple parent classes).

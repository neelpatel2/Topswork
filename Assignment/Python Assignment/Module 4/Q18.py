#What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? 
"""
When the expression '1' == 1 is executed in Python, it evaluates to False. This is because '1' is a string, 
and 1 is an integer, and they are of different types.
In Python, the equality operator == checks if the values of the two operands are equal and also considers their
types. Since the types are different (string vs. integer), the comparison returns False.

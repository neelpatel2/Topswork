#How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python?Explain with coding snippets.
'''
try block:
This block contains the code that might throw an exception.
except block: 
This block contains the code that will execute if an exception occurs in the try block. 
You can specify the type of exception to catch.
finally block: 
This block contains code that will execute no matter what, even if an exception was raised.
It's typically used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.

#Example
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")

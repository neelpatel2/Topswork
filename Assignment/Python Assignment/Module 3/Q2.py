#How will you remove last object from a list? Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?
'''To remove the last object from a list in Python, you can use the pop() method without any arguments.
This will remove and return the last item of the list.
#example
list1 = [5, 52, 22, 17, 37]
list1.pop()
print(list1) 
# Output: [ 5, 52, 22, 17 ]
'''
#The expression list1[-1] in Python is used to access the last item in the list.
list1 = [5, 52, 22, 17, 37]
print(list1[-1])

#How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?
'''
You can create a dictionary using tuples in Python by converting a list of tuples into a dictionary.
Each tuple in the list should contain exactly two elements, where the first element will be used as
the keyand the second element will be used as the value in the dictionary.

#Example
list_of_tuples = [('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2'), ('key3', 'value3')]

my_dict = dict(list_of_tuples)

print(my_dict)

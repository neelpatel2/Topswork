#Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
'''
"append()"
append(): Adds a single element to the end of the list.Takes one argument, which can be any data type (e.g., number, string, another list, etc.).
Operation: The argument is added as a single element, even if it is a list.
#Example:
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.append([6, 7])
print(list1) 
# Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
"extend()"
extend():Adds each element of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, etc.) to the end of the list.Takes one argument,
which must be an iterable.
Operation:Each element of the iterable is added to the list individually.
#Example:
list1 = [1, 2, 4]
list1.extend([5, 6])
print(list1) 
# Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
